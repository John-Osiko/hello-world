# hello-world

## This is my trial website
## My lesson on README.md, July 7,2020 


## Description
Markdown is a desciption of a website.
It is built to make users and other developers easily know about your application on website once they open the source file.

# DEMO

# {Application Name}
#### {Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}
#### By **{List of contributors}**
## Description
{This is a detailed description of your application, including its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place. }
## Technologies Used
{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}
## Support and contact details
{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}
### License

Licensing
An open source license details how others can use your code. Adding a license to your repository is a good practice because it is how you state your intent.

MIT and GPL are the most common licenses. An MIT license means your code is free to use by anyone and you are not liable (Rails and jQuery use an MIT license). GPL also indicates free usage of the code but when used, the resulting work MUST be open source (Linux, Git and Wordpress use GPL).

For additional details on choosing a license for your code, visit GitHub's Choose a License site (Links to an external site.).
